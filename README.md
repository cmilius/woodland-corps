# Woodland Corps

## Overview

This is a web page for my Dungeons and Dragons campaign and is published using [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This repository contains the source code, documentation, and resources needed to develop, test, and deploy the web page.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To set up your development environment for local development, follow the [instructions provided by GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll).

### Running the Application

- Open a git bash terminal in the project's root folder
- Run `exec jekyll serve`
> Note: Jekyllâ€™s built-in server does not automatically reload configuration changes from _config.yml. If you update _config.yml, you must stop the running server and restart it for the new settings to take effect. 
- Your site will be made available at http://localhost:4000
- Jekyll will continue to run in the terminal and rebuild & deploy the site locally whenever changes are saved to any file
