Our last session begins with Father shoving a crude mask onto Huckleberry’s face, which swiftly overpowers him and sends the pair bursting through the walls. As the father/son duo make their grand escape, a banshee-like scream rings out through the cavern, prompting something to buck against the Undermountain and shake most of you off your feet. Except Yuka, now that’s a guy who can stand.

As you set out through the busted door, you see Nyx fighting for her life against the loyalist faction leader, Tashi. Many of you are quick to rush to her aid, while Sulu leads the charge into the tunnels. Here, our 5 ft fish sorcerer runs into the enigmatic cult leader, Dialgo Inconto, who very quickly decides Sulu is in his way – queue gulp.mp3.

But his attention quickly shifts as Kiwi unsheathes the sword of legend, Blade, prompting Dialgo to shift into a wolf-man warrior. Dialgo jumps around the room and unleashes a barrage of spectral blades at the party – which would have left more of a mark were it not for Yuka’s absurdly potent healing.

Tashi falls, and not much later Team 287’s own Kitty Cutter plunges Blade through Dialgo’s chest – absorbing them both and putting an end to the EoV’s shot-lived plans plans for Skullport.

But the party does not linger, for Father and Huckleberry have gotten quite the head start as they heed the enthralling call of the Siren Sovereign.
