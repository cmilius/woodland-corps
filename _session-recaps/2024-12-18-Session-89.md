In our last session, the party delves below the rolling hills of Drakkenrest – welcomed by splintering cracks from the dark entity that lurks there. Po and Kaladin’s recon mission afforded them little detail beyond finding an egg and being hunted by something both large and malicious. However, after talking it over with their teammates, the task ahead became woefully clear. Between them and the third egg there is a primordial – and they must be the ones to destroy it.

Taking advantage of the conveniently-placed crevasse, the party makes their dark descent into the cavern. Here, Veera taps into the celestial origins of her Infernal patron – donning an angelic visage with a Divine Greatshield to match.

What follows is as much a battle as it is a gauntlet for survival, where each turn subjects you to a cruel and unrelenting march towards certain annihilation. As your party endeavors to collapse the cavern on this monster, the void’s absolution is revealed as you all watch Po’s body become erased from this plane. With one ally gone and the rest mere feet from the black, beating heart of unnexistence – Kiwi forgoes his safety and nose dives toward the void – striking the final blow and relieving this ancient force of its ill-gains – both mortal and divine.
