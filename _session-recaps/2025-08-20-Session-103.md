In our last session, we kick off our clash with the Mad Monkey, Malar. The bloodthirsty beast lord reveals this mass, sacrificial slaughter is all he can do to earn the eerie adoration of the shadowy goddess above, who is said to obscure the Morninglord’s gaze as she delights in mortal torment and slaughter. 

Furthermore, his manipulation of Vicarion was two-fold. First, to have the much stronger birddrake hunt Apecs and gather their power, but also to siphon away Vicarion’s powers granted to him by the Ova Mundis.

Putting the Monk in Monkey, Malar humbles our heavy hitters, taking on Daddy’s Little Demigods and one demi-dog as you slowly, but surely, drum cracks into his astral defense. However, with a righteous uppercut, Po puts down his little brother’s bully as Veera puppets him to crush his final relic.

And finally, after giving Malar the brutal death he asked for, a centuries old reincarnation spell begins to stir – slowly merging the black-blooded malarites into a single, monstrous body. However, Sulu puts it all on the line to counter this malignant renewal, and – at great, personal cost – shows that mortals, too, can meddle in the affairs of gods.
