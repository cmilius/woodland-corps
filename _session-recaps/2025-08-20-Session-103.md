In our last session, we kick off our clash with the Mad Monkey, Mala, Where, the bloodthirsty beast lord reveals this mass, sacrificial slaughter is all he can do to distract the many wills of the Wandering Moon. 

You learn his manipulation of Vicarion was two-fold. First, to have the much stronger birddrake hunt Apecs for Malar, but also to siphon away Vicarion’s powers granted to him by the Ova Mundis.

Putting the Monk in Monkey, Malar humbles our heavy hitters, taking on Daddy’s Little Demigods (and one demi-dog) as you slowly, but surely, drum cracks into his astral defenses. However, with a righteous uppercut, Po puts down his little brother’s bully as Veera puppets him to crush his final relic.

After giving Malar the brutal beatdown he asked for, a centuries old reincarnation spell begins to stir – slowly merging the black-blooded malarites into a single, monstrous body. However, Sulu puts it all on the line to counter this malignant revival, and – at great, personal cost – shows that mortals, too, can medle in the affairs of gods. 

And finally, just as you set sail for Arborea, Shar makes way for the Morninglord to deliver radiant absolution to the Apec-courting capital of Karasuthra.
