Following the events at the Rune Fields, the party spends the ensuing days preparing for their first mission -- strengthening their minds, bodies, and resolve for who or what they may face along the way.

You stock up at Fredricks and relieve yourselves of excess supplies. The nails-on-a-chalkboard-sounding Regi Flowers is also given a quick visit, though no one seems interested in what’s left of his wares.

The Debriefment Council finds you wandering the shopping district -- and Beelzebrandy, Thealzia, and Gwynerva all wish you well on your journey to Estergas. They also compensate you 50 gold pieces each for dealing with Riona before any more damage was incurred to the base -- though many of you were quick to label these payments as ‘hush money’.

Sulu then empties 2 entire pounds of mayonnaise right onto the ground -- and lights it on fire, because he can.

With your final day over, you all go to sleep and ready yourselves for what will surely be the most momentous of daybreaks.
