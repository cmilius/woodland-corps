In our last session, we learn Veera’s brother, Damian, is being leveraged against her by the Archdevil, Asmodeus. And while Veera is innocent (in this regard), the sins of her soul have not been forgotten by the Supreme Ruler of Hell. And so, she is to kneel before his throne in Nessus and make amends for her legion’s spiritual desertion at the efforts of Zariel.

As Team 287 employs the help of every 4-year old in arm’s reach – you orchestrate an on-the-spot moon heist with Rednet. With the power four, draconic deities at your disposal, you usurp the cracked moon (gods included) and place it gently in the Frostmount’s skies.

Emerging from an interplanar leap, the Spelljammer appears between the warring planes of Mechanus and Acheron. Here you meet a modron commander, Zeus, who reveals the spark of Mechanus has been lost – the apparent aftermath of Doth Talbot passing through. And so, as their plane crumbles and their own lives wane – the Modron machinate their final march, hoping to sacrifice themselves before the King of Hell can execute his grand scheme – whatever that is.
Somewhere below, the final and most potent piece of a deific puzzle awaits -- Tiamat's Soul -- a most useful tool in reshaping your worlds -- be you Asmodeus, King of Devils; or Doth Talbot, mortal's unchosen savior.
