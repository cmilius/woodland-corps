In our last session, the party delves into Phandalin proper – finding Sulu’s errant fireball has not only dropped a giant on the town, but trapped an equally large snake as well. Opting not to test its temperament, you all agree to leave it be until you have dealt with your other obligations. Standing between you and your path inside, you opt to un-gigantify a once giant spider and simply walk by as it fails to do anything about it.

As you splash its allies across the dark interior of the inn, Yuka and his completely unremarkable eyes walk right into a 50 ft hole, sustaining injuries that could best be described as miraculously benign. Inside, Veera uncovers the inn’s guestbook, finding the signatures of Po’s parents, as well as Teggun’s shawl she used to carry Po and his yet-to-be-named siblings.

Descending with a bit more grace, Daddy’s little spelunkers join their battered druid – and take on the keystone of the Nothic’s thrall – Nezznar, the Black Spider. The now-mutated drow puts up a commendable fight, but is unable to escape Mari’s blind, double 360 no-scopes and is quickly put down. Upon his revival, Nezznar shows a microsecond of gratitude, followed by several minutes of grotesque seething and bargaining. With the promise of information and other, magical rewards, you allow the wizard to join you as he contemplates revenge against his years-long master.
