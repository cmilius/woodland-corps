In our last session, Team 287 continues its war path to squash a troubling influence – both for the Beastlands, as well as Po’s giant, little brother. The party makes quick work of the Mad Monkey's goons, felling moose, goose, and mammoth – oh my! Marsh, as dubious as he is dumbfounded by your party's parallel intentions, takes you to his secret tunnels – which he has been preparing for an all-or-nothing raid against Malar.

In the tunnels, Blade assumes control of Kiwi, finally acquainting itself with the party and promising retribution if you destroy its relic. In exchange for your temperance, however, Blade offers an alternative solution to the inevitable, primordial ‘Oneness’ – escape. After you overcome the primordial tied to Malar’s many relics, Blade will consume this primordial’s power and attempt to shatter the Crystal Sphere surrounding Edena and the outer planes. Perhaps there is more to consider, be that Blade’s offer – or when to cut it down.

In a woefully unserious charge through absolute carnage, Yuka tempts the bloodthirsty masses while the group sneaks across the battlefield. Once inside Malar’s den, you destroy yet another of his relics, leaving him with just his ichor-filled cup and earning the immediate attention of the big ape himself.
