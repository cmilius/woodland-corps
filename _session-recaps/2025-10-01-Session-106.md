In our last session – over a month ago – the party throws down and goes down the Tarrasque. Once the guardian of the Three Kingdoms, this towering behemoth now exists to protect Teggun Tyson – who is utterly convinced that it is her child. The lonely aarokokra seems wholly indifferent to the suffering of Po’s friends, which puts a real damper on this mother-son reunion. 

As Sulu, Yuka, Veera, and Mari delve into a mythical gut-dungeon, they face off against the Tarrasque’s guarddrake immune system, navigating flame-filled tunnels and irradiant bile as they descend upon a titanic heart. Outside, Kiwi and Marsh attempt to distract the beast with diamond munitions, bumping fists and aiming for the molars – eventually baptizing our newest member in a stew of divine source. 

With Teggun restrained, Team 287 cuts open the Tarrasque’s heart and sends Po into the crimson egg. Here, he sets foot in the serene fields of Goldenglade – the fertile demi-plane of the Draconic Deity, Rurr. While the pair acknowledge Teggun’s difficult life, they agree she is better off without this power.

And so, the power of Rurr and The Tarrasque now rest in the hands of Po and his brother – who will, perhaps, use this power more virtuously.
