You all clash with Riona and her fellow bandits that are leading an assault on you from beyond the veil. Some of you were a little more gassed than others coming into this fight and that led to interesting tactics to ensure no one died. Sulu joins the fight from the back of his new, giant salamander friend named Sally, and provides arcane cover fire from across the Rune Fields.

Riona surprises everyone by getting so angry that her ethereal form morphs into a towering rage golem covered in weapons and armor from the training grounds. It was a grueling slog but you managed to come out victorious, Driktur telling you to help yourself to the damaged armor and weapons that littered the battlefield -- some of you getting a little grabbier than others.

Many of you express your concerns to Driktur of what had just transpired and he says it’s, unfortunately, something that happens from time to time -- though not to that severity. He assures you he’ll work on finding a solution while you all head back home. There, you find several letters from your bandit pal Ultimus as well as a cute drawing from Aywin Bradley.

The final letter is from the desk of Councilor Gregory Beelzebrandy detailing your first mission. You’re set to visit Kiwi’s hometown of Cretia at the border of Estergas to investigate some strange anomalies in the ecosystem.
