After a harrowing escape from the collapsing Tarrasque, the party is confronted by one of Doth Talbot’s puppets. Despite revealing he has taken the remaining eggs and the dark goddess Lolth under his thrall, Team 287 remains unshaken, with Veera destroying Talbot’s puppet and draconic sceptre.

On your passage back to Honey Run, Judah prepares to save Kiwi from Blade. After a quick talk and a miraculously tossed spoon, Kiwi agrees to Judah’s terms and accepts the divine artifact, Deicide. After freeing Ramazall’s spirit into lands unknown, Blade’s relic is finally destroyed – the irate primordial promising retribution for Kiwi’s betrayal.

Touching down in Honey Run, the frayed ends of Po’s life finally meet – Silva thanking Teggun for sharing her sons with him, and the boondiggle boys filling the child-sized holes in the lonely woman’s heart.

And finally, Team 287 is reunited with the OG NPC, Podrick – who has joined just in time to go to Hell. With him, he has brought some familiar faces, including two, new Woodland Corps. Sprouts – Damien and Poly. Though Veera’s little brother appears to be going through the same transformation she once did, Bippa is not so sure.
