We kick off our last session with a peek into an old and bloody mask, used to track down Teggun Tyson after she was reborn into Edena. In this vision, we see the bird in her previous life, as a disheveled roc on the brink of death. Under the direction of Skylord Pavo, the large bird consumed the Ova Mundus – setting in motion a scheme to rebirth the Beastland’s guardian spirit into a body with wings. 

Entering the Skies of Honey Run, Daddy’s Little Daddies break the news to Vicarion, convincing the giant bird to accept his power, their support, and Malar’s betrayal. Slowing down, his spark returns to him, making him whole but also really, really cool. 

Returning to his given name of Rednet, Po’s little brother is introduced to Mr. Silva and Beelzebrandy, welcomed with open arms into their unique, ever-growing family.

Eventually, the group corners Skylord Pavo, and demands answers. The cowering Beast Lord says it quite simply – between the Apecs and the Wandering Moon, The Beastlands need more than the tethered and mindless Spirit of the Ova Mundus. They need a guardian who can soar anywhere – even other planes – and develop a (potentially malleable) sense of justice. And so, Pavo made such a hero, and all it cost was the life and joy of one, unfortunate bird.
