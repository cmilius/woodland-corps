In our last session, the party launches into action as the creature called forth by Maria’s clever trap moves on to bigger prey when it finds it has been fooled. You all run into the adjacent orchard and find the massive hawk has morphed itself into an even larger bear that aims to consume the wounded, canid guard, Ornstin. 

In a stunning display of swiftness and determination, Team 287 pulls out all the stops and unloads spell after bear trap after spell on this terrifying creature. The dark, violet-eyed entity tries to escape into the water but is given no opportunity to retreat. Kiwi rushes in and unfurls a brutal onslaught of swipes and slashes and is able to finish off and subdue the beast with the psychic enchantments of his Dream Saber. 

As it falls to the ground, its dark exterior melts into an obsidian ichor and begins seeping into the beach’s sand – revealing a small, exhausted rabbit at its core. Kaladin spares not a second of hesitation and runs across the dark pool, falling victim to its necrotic sting as he lunges for the defenseless animal. Using her infernal chain Veera yanks the young druid out of the ichor’s grasp and Maria fills a vial with the black substance as it once again falls into the sand.
