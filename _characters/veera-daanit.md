## Biography

We’ve come a long way since your days fresh out of the Academy, like that night you went out drinking and Veera woke up a devil. This spurred a tumultuous sea of feelings for the young adventurer, certain her parents had conspired with higher powers to ruin her chance at a normal life. However, you would soon learn of your soul’s millenia’s long attempts to be freed from an infernal cycle – one that began thousands of years ago as the human paladin, Versces who stormed Avernus under Zariel’s creed. In this life, you have found a loving family, a secret younger brother, and even a green cousin I threw in as a bonus! Slowly, Veera is unraveling the mysteries of her previous lives, and is on course to take her inherited powers to new and radiant heights.
