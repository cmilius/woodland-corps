## Biography

While Mari may have been my first kill, Kaladin has the even greater honor of being my first kiss. I wasn’t sure if anyone would find romance in my bi-weekly dnd campaign, but now that Kaladin’s bit the bullet I’m flirting with all of you fools. Veera and Vespa? Smoochin. Mari and that guy from Skullport? Straight mackin. Sulu? High fiving himself like a goddamn pervert! Much like last year, my bit for Kaladin has gone off the rails. To bring it back around, Kaladin has had a bit of an identity crisis for most of the campaign – having forces far beyond his control shape and guide him regardless of his thoughts on the matter. In a relatively short period of time, you were a green boy, a plant boy, a tree, even more of a plant boy, an egg, and a dragon. But now, as an ascendant being, all is quiet. The higher powers like eldath, goeyx, and bahamut cannot see or sense you, and now, for the first time in your relatively short life – you hold the reins to your own future.
