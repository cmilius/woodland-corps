## Biography

To say Sulu has had a rough go of it would certainly be something of an understatement, not that he’s the type to let it show. First, he was sent away under the guise of a foreign exchange program where he spent many years acclimating to a completely alien world. Here, he would do his best to reign in a mysterious command of fire beneath his bubbling charm and wondrous view of the surface world. And now, if certain figures are to be believed, it seems Sulu was quietly exiled from his people – and that his own body has become a conduit for a primordial’s relic, the very enemy tritons have sworn themselves to defeat and protect Edena against.

### Backstory

In the great underwater city Hyldor lived a race of proud Tritons.  Every inhabitant knew from birth it was their duty to protect and nurture the oceans that they called home.  Hyldorians naturally excel in one or several skills.  Some are amazing with a blade while others are amazing at crafting them.  Sulu however, was one of the few unable to uncover any natural talents.  The most Sulu could muster was making streams of bubbles from his hands.

One day, Sulu was called to Zandas's (the King of Hyldor) throne.  Excited at the chance to prove himself to the king, he appeared without haste.  Zandas revealed to Sulu that there was more to the world than the sea.  There was a surface above it.  An organization named the Woodland Corps was recruiting members and relentlessly contacting the king seeking candidates.  Their attempts were always in vain as the Hyldorians had a strong bond to the sea and their duties to protect it, but Zandas had an idea to appease them both and offered the opportunity to Sulu.

Sulu decided to join and see if he could be of more use to the Sea from the surface and prove himself to his people.

Upon his arrival to the Corps, Sulu was quite literally a fish out of water.  He stumbled up to a rather judgmental man at the check-in point who remarked "Well...it seems like we're letting anyone into the Corps now...Sulu was it?  Please show me your 'exceptional' talent..."  Embarrassed but eager to prove himself he put out his hand to demonstrate and said "I can shoot bubbles from my hands!"  Instead of bubbles however, he shot red hot flames from the palm of his hands and singed the man's eyebrows clean off!  

And so his reputation as a fire hazard began...
