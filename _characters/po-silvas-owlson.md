## Biography

Po. Po. A P and an O. Two letters to show I'm an owl boy who continues to grow. The creatures I eat, the ones im told no, is it okay to kill a god? Maybe, but I do not know. If you're a friend, a hug i'll bestow, if you're a foe, a missile i'll throw. When sneaking around, I tip on my toe, when hunting for bugs, in my feathers they'll stow. Where is my mom? Is she a crow? Just tell me where, and there I will go. I love my green dad, though his knee I've outgrown, but I live by his creed to just go with the flow. What does it mean, to be lycanthrope? Does it make me a beast, what lines must I toe? A piece of two worlds, together they're sewn, down the river of life I'll continue to row. This world, Edena, has so much left to show, and in a story so grand I still manage to glow.
