<!-- This is your introduction paragraph. It will appear in the characters.md page list -->
Yuka’s story began quite some years ago as he followed the meandering guidance of the Aurora Polaris and ended up at the Woodland Corps. Academy. Since then, he has made well on his promise to save people, protect nature, and take in the cultures of the world to one day to share with the people of Innuksuk. Since then, he has fought dinosaurs, joined a gang of witches, almost married Mari’s sister, and participated in one of the biggest heists in Faerunian history. That is to say, he’s had a pretty rad time. As the soon-to-be-archdruid of the Northern Wildfire, Yuka has done well in focusing on what’s in front of him and not looking too far ahead – as life is at its richest in the moment. While he may be the only scout remaining in Team 287 – he also has a personal party plane full of talking animals. So take that, everyone else.
