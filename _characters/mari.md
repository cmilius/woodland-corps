## Biography

When we began this campaign, Mari scurried into graduation (late, I’ll remind you) their approach sounding similar o someone who had just dropped an arm full of pots and pans – quite literally a shell of their former self. In Waterdeep, we embarked on a grand journey to uncover what lay beneath your brassen exterior, and there we found your true identity as the lost Princess from centuries passed. We fought your tyrannical mother, freed your family, and found your key – granting you a new body affixed with an advanced case of shell sickness. What’s more, you seem to be haunted by the ghost of your attempted savior, Nora Steelsworn, the daughter of a particularly grumpy and jorts-wearing dwarf.
