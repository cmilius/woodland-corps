## Biography

Kiwi keeps things brief, but that doesn’t mean I have to. It’s been years since we left the eclectic jungles of Cretia – and those weird, magic, poop monkeys, too. Intentionally or otherwise, Kiwi fulfills a traditional role in the fantasy story – the confident, laid back swordsman who fears boredom more than death. Whether it’s snatching Mari’s key or killing the leader of your own sword’s cult Kiwi cuts into any adventure like the tip of his crazy ass sword. Seriously, there’s a whole ass primordial in there – the soul of Sulu's old character and Kaladin’s girlfriend’s dad! Does anyone else’s sword have all that inside? No, or at least not both of those things.
